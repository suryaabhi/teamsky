Hello Devs!
Here is a list of subtasks that you can use to split the work/track your progress!
Might look like a lot but there is a lot of redundancy in the tasks,
Additionally we are here to assist!

Pseudo code for flow - Need not be followed strictly, just a guideline:
While True:
    make_camera_look_at_floor() [Needs to be written, use servo code from Utils.MotorUtils.py internally]
    marker = run_path_follower() [Defined in PathMoverUtils.py]
    if marker is [Marker values defined in ARTagUtils.py]:
            0: MarkerAction.READ_BILLBOARD_1 => 
                read_billboard_1() [Needs to be defined to return pick/drop object and color]
            1: MarkerAction.PICK_OBJECT_LEFT =>
            2: MarkerAction.PICK_OBJECT_RIGHT =>
                find_and_move_to_object(color, shape, initial_dir) [Needs to be defined, use MotorUtils.py & HSVTester.py]
                pick_object() [Needs to be defined, use MotorUtils.py]
            3: MarkerAction.DROP_OBJECT_LEFT =>
            4: MarkerAction.DROP_OBJECT_RIGHT =>
                find_and_move_to_object(color, shape, initial_dir) [Defined by you up]
                drop_object() [Needs to be defined, use MotorUtils.py]
            5: MarkerAction.READ_BILLBOARD_2 =>
                read_billboard_2() [Needs to be defined to return lane]
            6: MarkerAction.EXECUTE_LANE =>
                execute_lane() [Needs to be defined, use MotorUtils.py]
            7: MarkerAction.READ_BILLBOARD_3 =>
                read_billboard_3() [Needs to be defined to return text]
            8: MarkerAction.WRITE_LETTER =>
                find_and_move_to_object(color, shape, initial_dir) [Defined by you up]
                pick_object() [Defined by you up, used to pick pen]
                write_letter() [Needs to be defined, use MotorUtils.py]

Tasks that can be done in parallel:
1. read_billboard_1 / read_billboard_2 / read_billboard_3 -> setup Open AI APIs
2. pick_object_left / pick_object_right / drop_object_left / drop_object_right -> control gripper angle and height
3. find_and_move_to_object -> detecting obj based on color/shape using openCV then calling MotorUtils to move
4. write_letter -> WILD CARD CHALLENGE! High bonus for this task!
